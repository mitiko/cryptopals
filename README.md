# cryptopals - real world crypto challanges

This is a set of [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag)-like
crypto challanges where you exploit real eaxmples of badly implemented
cryptography.

I stumbled across this accidentally on my GitHub explore page when
[@dreamsmasher](https://github.com/dreamsmasher) followed
[@enncoded](https://github.com/enncoded) and I saw they had some rust projects,
amongst which a try at cryptopals.  
So I got inspired. Let's write some crypto.
